#Several Scripts for Github hosted on Github

to use these scripts ensure that the scripts are IN THE DIRECTORY
FOR YOUR GIT REPO

(in the case of create_repo put it in whatever folder you want to become a git repo)

the scripts will ask for any data it needs

use git launcher for an easy all in one

NODE: Push all and Pull All need to be in the root git directory (along with clone_repo)
